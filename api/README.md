# Working with the ArchivesSpace API

## Authentication

Most actions against the backend require you to be logged in as a user
with the appropriate permissions. By sending a request like:

     POST /users/admin/login?password=login

your authentication request will be validated, and a session token
will be returned in the JSON response for your request.  To remain
authenticated, provide this token with subsequent requests in the
`X-ArchivesSpace-Session` header.  For example:

     X-ArchivesSpace-Session: 8e921ac9bbe9a4a947eee8a7c5fa8b4c81c51729935860c1adfed60a5e4202cb

### Example requests using CURL

Send request to authenticate:

```
curl -s -F password="admin" "http://localhost:8089/users/admin/login"
```

This will return a JSON response that includes something like the following:

```
{
   "session":"9528190655b979f00817a5d38f9daf07d1686fed99a1d53dd2c9ff2d852a0c6e",
   ....
}
```

Itâ€™s a good idea to save the session key as an environment variable to use for later requests:

```
# Mac/Unix terminal
export SESSION="9528190655b979f00817a5d38f9daf07d1686fed99a1d53dd2c9ff2d852a0c6e"

# Windows Command Prompt
set SESSION="9528190655b979f00817a5d38f9daf07d1686fed99a1d53dd2c9ff2d852a0c6e"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:SESSION="9528190655b979f00817a5d38f9daf07d1686fed99a1d53dd2c9ff2d852a0c6e"
```

Now you can make requests like this:

```
curl -H "X-ArchivesSpace-Session: $SESSION" "http://localhost:8089/repositories/2/resources/1
```

## CRUD

The ArchivesSpace API provides CRUD-style interactions for a number of
different "top-level" record types.  Working with records follows a
fairly standard pattern:

     # Get a paginated list of accessions from repository '123'
     GET /repositories/123/accessions?page=1

     # Create a new accession, returning the ID of the new record
     POST /repositories/123/accessions
     {... a JSON document satisfying JSONModel(:accession) here ...}

     # Get a single accession (returned as a JSONModel(:accession) instance) using the ID returned by the previous request
     GET /repositories/123/accessions/456

     # Update an existing accession
     POST /repositories/123/accessions/456
     {... a JSON document satisfying JSONModel(:accession) here ...}
