# Performing GET requests

GET requests typically fall into the following categories:
  * Calculations: extents, dates, containers
  * Fetching parent/child data: tree information, tree paths, record slices
  * Retrieving a given record by identifier/component ID
  * Retrieving a given record by URI
  * Retrieve lists of data: locations, permissions, subjects, etc.
  * Get streams of data: deleted records, notifications, updated records
  * Get data in other formats: EAD, EAC-CPF, Dublin Core, etc.
