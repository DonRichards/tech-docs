# Security considerations when running ArchivesSpace

# This is but a draft outline - For initial thoughts and review only

ArchivesSpace is an open source application that depends on a large number of third party libraries and systems. 

While ArchivesSpace is developed using coding best practices and is routinely scanned for security issues, it is possible for ArchivesSpace or some components of ArchivesSpace to contain security vulnerabilities that would allow unexpected or dangerous behavior to be triggered. 

[This policy](https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/blob/master/SECURITY.md) explains how to report security issues.
